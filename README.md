## Description
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Kaggle MBTI Dataset (8,600+ users) to challenge real-world stereotypes in the digital space. Using Python, Pandas, and Plotly, I transformed unstructured text data into measurable insights, revealing that Introverts (INxx) dominate the online landscape and are just as active as Extraverts. The project also explores how punctuation usage serves as a predictor for Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) traits.
